## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned and practiced several important front-end skills. I usually rely on Flexbox for layout, but I am intentionally working on using CSS Grid more to expand my skills and get more comfortable with its capabilities:

- **Semantic HTML5**: I used semantic elements like `<main>`, proper heading levels, and descriptive `alt` text to improve accessibility and structure.
- **CSS Grid for Centering**: I used CSS Grid's `place-items: center` to perfectly center the QR code component both vertically and horizontally on the page. This project was a great opportunity to practice Grid, since I tend to reach for Flexbox by default.
- **Accessibility (ARIA)**: I added ARIA labels and roles to make the component more accessible to screen readers.
- **Custom Properties**: I used CSS custom properties for easier color and style management.
- **Responsive Design**: I ensured the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

Example of the centering technique:

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

Example of semantic and accessible HTML:

```html
<main class="content" role="main" aria-label="QR code component">
  <img
    src="./images/image-qr-code.png"
    alt="Scan this QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and improve your front-end skills"
  />
  <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  <p>
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
    next level

</main>
```
